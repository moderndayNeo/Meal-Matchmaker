## Outline - project outline

Meal Matchmaker provided me an opportunity to combine the latest coding practices into one project.
I coded the whole app using React Hooks with Typescript.
To get the recipe data I make asynchronous calls to a recipe API and then display instructions, ingredients
and a handful of related recipes that users can also choose from.

For the design of the app I teamed up with UI Designer Putra Narassa (https://www.facebook.com/putra.narassa).
His incredible designs and efforts allowed me to focus on the code and on building an app that runs as smooth as possible.

For the CSS styles, I focused on creating a project that is as scalable and maintainable as possible. I use
CSS variables, media queries and relative sizes throughout the app to make my pages dynamic.
All animations and transitions are written in pure CSS to ensure speed.
